Credit Card Fraud Detection Systems using Machine Learning Algorithms
This was a minor project as a part of the course "Data Mining Techniques". It deals with data analysis and visualisation. We used a total of 10 machine learning algorithms first on an imbalanced and then on a balanced dataset. The tools used were Python and WEKA. We are glad to have published a paper on the project as well.
